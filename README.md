# internship-demos

This repository contains demo projects replicating tasks I worked on during internships.  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: All uploaded content has been approved by the companies before sharing. No confidential or sensitive information is included. Some scripts require proprietary data which is not provided here, so they may not run directly.

## üìÇ LiAuto_Demos
Internship projects focused on **data analysis and process automation**:
1. **Battery Thermal Management** ‚Äì analysis of signals related to thermal balancing requirements.  
2. **Standard Manufacturing Conversions** ‚Äì transforming and producing standardized process data.  
3. **Defective Part & Work Order Matching** ‚Äì linking offline part inspection results with production work orders.

## üìÇ Stardust_Demos
Internship projects combining **data engineering and computer vision**:
1. **Import & Export Tasks** ‚Äì JSON/JSONL data pipeline for annotation and pre-labeling import/export.  
2. **3D ‚Üî 2D Mapping & Point Cloud Reconstruction** ‚Äì learning projects exploring stereo re-projection, undistortion, and reconstruction of 3D point clouds from images.  
3. **OSS General Utility Scripts** ‚Äì integrated Python tools for uploading, downloading, and validating data via OSS (Object Storage Service).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimers
- All scripts uploaded here have been reviewed and cleared by the companies.  
- To **protect proprietary data**, some dataset references and table names were anonymized.  
- As a result, certain scripts may not run out-of-the-box due to missing input data.  
- These examples represent **a subset** of the actual tasks completed during the internships, meant solely to **illustrate the type of work and skillsets** involved.
- Since the companies are **based in China**, some scripts **contain Chinese comments/are named in Chinese**. Translating them fully into English would be too time-consuming, so I kept them as-is. I apologize for any difficulty in understanding caused by this.

## üí° Notes
- The repository is structured by internship (`LiAuto_Demos` and `Stardust_Demos`) for clarity.  
- Scripts emphasize **Python, SQL, and data pipeline engineering** as well as **3D vision fundamentals**.  
- This repo serves as a **portfolio-style showcase**, not as a full production environment.
